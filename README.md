An abbreviation of common linux command-line utilities into one ctl


## Installation

Install `nionctl` with pip:

```
The PyPi page is availible [here.](https://pypi.org/project/nionctl/)


## Current commands (WIP):

- Wifi list and connect/disconnect
- `git clone` from url to default directory
- `neofetch` (because why not)

Any kinds of contributions are very welcome!
Currently the main goals are to bring more utilities and make the ctl cross-platform. Any tests on other linux distros are also welcome!
